# Installation

Neo aims to be usable without a sysadmin background. **After setup, you mostly use the web UI.** This page covers getting the machine installed once; the command snippets below are the bootstrap steps—you will not live in the terminal day to day.

Two paths, plus a fallback when the laptop cannot build the system:

| Path | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| **[A — Machine already runs NixOS](#path-a--machine-already-runs-nixos)** | Fresh or existing NixOS host you want to turn into Neo |
| **[B — Install from your laptop](#path-b--install-from-your-laptop-nixos-anywhere)** | Linux laptop that can build `x86_64-linux`; prepare config locally, install remotely with nixos-anywhere |
| **[Laptop cannot build](#when-the-laptop-cannot-build-mac-live-usb-or-wrong-architecture)** | Mac, architecture mismatch, or a live USB with too little disk — build **on the target** |

Also: [what you need](#what-you-need), [first login](#first-login), [minimal starter config](#minimal-starter-config), [disks (Disko)](#automatic-disk-layout-disko), [no public IP](#no-public-ip-streamproxy), [per-service ingress](#per-service-ingress), [after install](#after-install), [learning links](#learning-links).

---

## What you need

**In plain terms:**

- A computer (or VPS) for the homeserver  
- A **domain name**  
- Either a **public IP** with ports **80 and 443** reachable, **or** access to a **streamproxy** on a public machine (see [below](#no-public-ip-streamproxy))  
- SSH access during install, using **your** SSH public key in `core.ssh.authorizedKeys`  

There is **no default Linux password**. After install, SSH as `homeserver@…` (for `neo`) or `admin@…` with the key you put in settings. Both users share `core.hashedLinuxPassword` when you set one (console/sudo).

**You do not need:** to learn Docker Compose, hand-write Nginx configs, or open lots of ports. Only web traffic (80/443) is required from the outside.

---

## Path A — Machine already runs NixOS

### Prerequisites

- Minimal **NixOS** with network and **SSH** (public key preferred)  
- About **2+ cores and 4+ GB RAM** for several services (more for heavy media)  
- Domain DNS pointing at this host’s public IP (if not using streamproxy)  

Disk partitioning is already done on a normal install. Automatic wipe/format ([Disko](#automatic-disk-layout-disko)) is for Path B / reinstalls—not for a machine full of data you care about.

### 1. Bootstrap Neo on the host

```bash
nix-shell --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" -p git

nix run --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" --refresh \
  github:madebydamo/neo#neo -- init
```

This creates your homeserver configuration (from the official template) and starter settings.

After a full Neo install, configuration usually lives under:

`/var/neo/DATA/AppData/configuration`

### 2. Configure (prefer the web UI when available)

For the **first** bring-up, put at least the [minimal starter config](#minimal-starter-config) in place (domain, email, SSH key, login user, SWAG + Neo UI enabled).

Then apply:

```bash
nix run --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
  github:madebydamo/neo#neo -- activate
```

Once the **Neo** service is up, open the web UI in your browser. From then on:

1. Change options in the UI  
2. Use **Activate** in the UI  

You should not need the terminal for everyday service toggles.

### 3. Day-to-day (normal users)

| Do this | Not required |
|---------|----------------|
| Neo web → change settings → Activate | Learning the full CLI |
| Keep auto-update enabled if you want hands-off upgrades | Manual package hunts |

Power users: optional [CLI reference](CLI.md).

---

## Path B — Install from your laptop (nixos-anywhere)

Use this when the target is **not** Neo yet, or you want a clean install from another computer. Can **format the remote disk** automatically ([Disko](#automatic-disk-layout-disko)).

### Prerequisites

**Your laptop:**

- [Nix installed](https://nixos.org/download/) with [flakes enabled](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Flakes)  
- Must be able to **build `x86_64-linux`** (a typical x86_64 Linux machine). `nix run github:madebydamo/neo#neo` currently only provides that architecture.  
- Network path to the target over SSH  

If you are on a **Mac**, a live USB, or a machine that cannot build `x86_64-linux`, skip this path and use [when the laptop cannot build](#when-the-laptop-cannot-build-mac-live-usb-or-wrong-architecture). Passing `--system x86_64-linux` on Darwin still needs a Linux builder; it will not magically cross-compile NixOS.

**Target machine** ([nixos-anywhere requirements](https://nix-community.github.io/nixos-anywhere/)):

- Reachable via **SSH** as root, or a user with **passwordless sudo**  
- Either a **NixOS installer**, or **x86_64 / aarch64 Linux with [kexec](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/kexec.8.html)** support (common on VPS images), and roughly **≥ 1.5 GB RAM** free for the installer step  
- You accept that Disko will **erase** the disks you configure  

Official docs require **kexec** (or a NixOS installer)—not KVM—on the target for the remote install path. A live USB’s root is usually a **tmpfs**; there is often not enough space to build on the target unless you [mount extra disk](#when-the-laptop-cannot-build-mac-live-usb-or-wrong-architecture).

### 1. Init Neo on the laptop

```bash
mkdir -p ~/neo-homeserver && cd ~/neo-homeserver

cat > settings.toml << 'EOF'
[neo-cli]
template = "github:madebydamo/neo#homeserver"
bootstrapMethod = "template"

# Optional: local defaults to ./build, server defaults to /var/neo/DATA/AppData/configuration
# [neo-cli.local]
# configPath = "./build"
# [neo-cli.server]
# configPath = "/var/neo/DATA/AppData/configuration"

[services.system-updater]
enabled = true
EOF

nix run --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" --refresh \
  github:madebydamo/neo#neo -- --settings ./settings.toml init
```

Configuration appears under `./build` (local profile). The same settings file carries a **server** profile path for the homeserver and system-updater — no manual path rewrite before install.

### 2. Fill in domain, keys, disks

Before installing, set at least:

1. **Your SSH public key** (or you lock yourself out)  
2. **Disko** enabled and `mainDisk` set to the target disk (`lsblk` over SSH—e.g. `/dev/sda`, `/dev/vda`, `/dev/nvme0n1`)  
3. Domain, email, tinyauth user, services — [minimal starter config](#minimal-starter-config)  

### 3. Edit with Neo web on the laptop (do **not** Activate for the remote)

```bash
nix run --extra-experimental-features "nix-command flakes" \
  github:madebydamo/neo#neo -- --settings ./settings.toml web
```

Use the UI to fill domain, keys, Disko disk path, users, plugins, etc.

**Important:** do **not** press **Activate** here if this config is meant for the **remote** machine. Activate applies to the computer you are sitting on. For Path B, first install is **nixos-anywhere**; Activate is for later, **on the server**.

### 4. Install with nixos-anywhere

```bash
cd build
nix flake show   # confirm nixosConfigurations.neo exists

nix run github:nix-community/nixos-anywhere -- \
  --flake .#neo \
  --generate-hardware-config nixos-generate-config ./hardware-configuration.nix \
  --target-host root@TARGET_IP
```

With Disko enabled in your config, Neo already describes the disk layout—no separate disk file required for the default single-disk ZFS setup.

When it finishes, the target reboots into Neo/NixOS. SSH host keys change; clear old entries if needed:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R TARGET_IP
```

Then [first login](#first-login) as `homeserver@TARGET_IP`. Root SSH is disabled (`PermitRootLogin = no`).

---

## When the laptop cannot build (Mac, live USB, or wrong architecture)

Path B fails when:

- The laptop is **not** `x86_64-linux` (typical error on an Apple Silicon Mac: flake does not provide `apps.aarch64-darwin.neo` / `packages.aarch64-darwin.neo`)
- The laptop and target have **different architectures**, so nixos-anywhere cannot build the system locally
- The target is a **NixOS live USB** (or similar): `/` and `/nix` sit on a tmpfs, so a local `neo` / NixOS build runs out of space

**Workaround:** treat the target as Path A. Boot it (installer USB is fine), give Nix a real disk for the build, run `neo init` **on the machine**, then let Disko format the OS disk. The target still needs to be **x86_64-linux** for `github:madebydamo/neo#neo` (same CLI limitation as Path B).

If the box has **two drives** (example: SSD for Neo, HDD for extra space):

1. In Disko, set `mainDisk` to the **SSD** you are willing to wipe (the OS disk).
2. On the live system, **mount the HDD** somewhere durable and point Nix scratch at it so the build is not stuck in RAM/tmpfs. Device names vary (`lsblk`); do **not** mount the disk Disko will erase.

```bash
# Example only — use the extra disk, not mainDisk
lsblk
mkdir -p /mnt/scratch
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/scratch          # extra HDD partition
mkdir -p /mnt/scratch/tmp /mnt/scratch/nix
export TMPDIR=/mnt/scratch/tmp
# Optional: if /nix is still filling the USB tmpfs:
#   mount --bind /mnt/scratch/nix /nix
```

3. Install Nix if needed, then run the [Path A](#path-a--machine-already-runs-nixos) `nix run github:madebydamo/neo#neo -- init` commands **on the target** (not from the Mac).
4. Put [minimal starter config](#minimal-starter-config) in place, including your SSH public key and Disko `mainDisk`.
5. `neo activate` (or the equivalent first switch) on the target. Disko formats the SSD.
6. After Neo is up, you can add the HDD under Disko `additionalDisks` in the web UI **if you accept that Disko will wipe that disk**. Unmount the scratch mount first. If you want to keep the HDD as-is, leave it out of Disko.

`nixos-anywhere --build-on-remote` is the same idea (build on the target) and has the same space requirement: the live image still needs a disk for `/nix` / `TMPDIR`.

---

## First login

After install, SSH as **`homeserver`** with the key in `core.ssh.authorizedKeys`:

```bash
ssh homeserver@TARGET_IP
```

- There is **no default password**.
- Root login over SSH is off.
- `homeserver` is the account `neo` and the web UI run as. SSH there and `neo edit` / `neo web` work without a sudo password.
- `admin` is a separate wheel user (same SSH keys, same `hashedLinuxPassword`) for interactive sudo and remote Nix builds. `neo` as `admin` re-execs with `sudo -u homeserver`, which needs that password.
- Optional: set `core.hashedLinuxPassword` (web UI helper or `mkpasswd -m sha-512`) if you want a console or sudo password. Leave it empty to keep password login locked.

Open the **Neo web UI** in a browser (once DNS and SWAG are happy) and manage the homeserver from there.

---

## Minimal starter config

Enough for a machine with **public IP**, **DNS** for your domain, and ports **80/443** open.

Generate a tinyauth password hash:

```bash
docker run -i -t --rm ghcr.io/tinyauthapp/tinyauth:v5.1.3 user create --interactive
```

(or use helpers in Neo web after bootstrap)

```toml
[core]
hostname = "homeserver"
# Optional. Empty = no Linux password (SSH keys only). There is no default.
# hashedLinuxPassword = "$6$rounds=...hash-from-mkpasswd..."

[core.ssh]
authorizedKeys = [
  "ssh-ed25519 AAAA... your-key",
]

[neo-cli]
template = "github:madebydamo/neo#homeserver"
# local.configPath defaults to ./build; server.configPath defaults to appdata/configuration

[services.system-updater]
enabled = true

[services.swag]
enabled = true
domain = "example.com"
email = "you@example.com"

[services.tinyauth]
enabled = true
# Web UI login (not a Linux account). Linux SSH is homeserver@ + authorizedKeys.
users = [
  "you:$2a$10$REPLACE_WITH_BCRYPT_HASH",
]
# Optional per-user app ACLs (neo service names). Empty = full access.
# [services.tinyauth.access.guest]
# allow = ["searxng", "homarr"]
# [services.tinyauth.access.kid]
# block = ["webtop"]

[services.neo]
enabled = true

[services.filebrowser]
enabled = true
```

**Path B — add Disko** (destructive format of that disk):

```toml
[disko]
enabled = true
mainDisk = "/dev/sda"
```

---

## Automatic disk layout (Disko)

For greenfield installs, Neo can partition with [Disko](https://github.com/nix-community/disko):

| Setting | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| `enabled` | Turn on automatic layout |
| `mainDisk` | Disk to wipe for the OS (EFI + ZFS) |
| `poolName` | ZFS pool name (default `zroot`) |
| `additionalDisks` | Extra disks → mount points (e.g. media) |

Default: boot partition + ZFS for the system and Neo data (with snapshots on Neo’s data dataset). One disk today: `mainDisk` becomes the OS pool (`zroot`). Extra disks in `additionalDisks` each get their own pool.

**Only enable when you intend to erase those disks.**

Live USB with too little space: [mount a second disk for the build](#when-the-laptop-cannot-build-mac-live-usb-or-wrong-architecture), keep `mainDisk` on the drive you want Disko to format.

---

## No public IP? Streamproxy

If the homeserver cannot accept inbound 80/443:

| Role | Where | Job |
|------|--------|-----|
| **Public edge** | VPS / box with public IP | **streamproxy** (+ optional local apps) |
| **Homeserver** | Home / private network | Your **data and apps**; tunnels out |

You still need:

1. **DNS** for your domains → **public** machine’s IP  
2. A working tunnel (rathole client on the homeserver, matching token on streamproxy)  
3. HTTPS and auth still terminate in the Neo stack as described in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)  

Illustrative fragments (tokens must match; check current ports in the UI):

**Public edge:**

```toml
[services.streamproxy]
enabled = true

[services.streamproxy.entries.home]
url = "home.example.com"
token = "shared-secret-token"
wildcard = true
includeTopLevel = true
```

**Homeserver (data stays here):**

```toml
[services.swag]
enabled = true
domain = "home.example.com"
email = "you@example.com"

[services.rathole]
enabled = true
token = "shared-secret-token"
remoteAddr = "edge.example.com"
port = 2223
name = "home"
```

One public IP and one homeserver? Run SWAG on that IP and leave streamproxy off.

### Per-service ingress

Each reverse-proxied service has an **`ingress`** multi-select: **`local`** (LAN), **`tailscale`** (tailnet), **`web`** (public HTTPS via rathole/streamproxy). Pick any combination; the default is all three (same behaviour as before). Dropping **`web`** makes that vhost return the packet-run **404** page on the public PROXY-protocol path; HTTP-01 on port 80 still works so certificates renew. Example — pastebin LAN-only:

```toml
[services.pastebin]
enabled = true
ingress = ["local"]
```

---

## After install

1. SSH as `homeserver@…` if you need a shell ([first login](#first-login))  
2. Open **Neo web**  
3. Enable services, set users, add [plugins](PLUGINS.md) under **Settings → core → plugins**  
4. **Activate** from the UI  
5. Leave **system-updater** (and **docker-updater**) on if you want hands-off upgrades  

Optional terminal tools: [CLI.md](CLI.md).
